# Exercise 8: Pulitzer Prizes

# Read in the data
pulitzer <- read.csv("data/pulitzer-circulation-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Install and load the needed libraries
# Be sure to comment out the install.packages function so it won't install it every time it runs
# Remeber you only need to install a package once
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

# View in the data set. Start to understand what the data columns contains
# Be sure to comment out the function so it won't view everytime you run the code.
#View(pulitzer)

# Use 'colnames' to print out the names of the columns
colnames(pulitzer)

# Use 'str' to print what types of values are contained in each column
# Did any value type surprise you? Why do you think they are that type?
print(str(pulitzer))

# Add a column in a dataframe called 'Pulitzer.Prize.Change` that contains the diffrence in changes
# in Pulitzer Prize Winners from 2004 to 2014 and Pultizer Prize Winners from 1990 to 2003.

# pulitzer$Pulitzer.Prize.Change <- abs(pulitzer$Pulitzer.Prize.Winners.and.Finalists..2004.2014 - pulitzer$Pulitzer.Prize.Winners.and.Finalists..1990.2003)

# Using dplyr
Pulitzer.Prize.Change <- mutate(pulitzer, difference.2004.2014.and.1990.2003 = 
                                Pulitzer.Prize.Winners.and.Finalists..2004.2014 -
                                Pulitzer.Prize.Winners.and.Finalists..1990.2003)


# What publication gained the most pulitzer prizes from 2004-2014?
# Be sure to use the pipe operator! 
most.prizes <- pulitzer %>%
  filter()

# Which publication with at least 5 Pulitzers won from 2004-2014 had the biggest decrease(negative) in Daily circulation numbers? 
# This publication should have Pulitzer prizes won a minimum of 5 Pulitzers, as well as the biggest decrease in circulation


# Your turn! An important part about being a data scientist is asking questions. 
# Create a question and use dplyr to figure out the answer.

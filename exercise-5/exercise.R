# Exercise 5: DPLYR Grouped Operations

# Install the nycflights13 package and read it in. Require the dplyr package.
# install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# In which month was the average departure delay the greatest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation before summarizing your data
delay.by.month <- group_by(flights, flights$months) %>% 
  summarise(mean(delay.by.month))

# If you create a data.frame with the columns "month", and "delay" above, you should be able to create 
# a scatterplot by passing it to the 'plot' function


# In which airport were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation before summarizing your data


### Bonus ###
# Which city was flown to with the highest average speed?
